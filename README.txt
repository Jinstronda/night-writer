🌙 NIGHT WRITER v1.1 - ENHANCED AUTOMATION
=========================================

🎉 WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.1:

✅ AUTOMATIC TASK FILE MANAGEMENT:
- ✅ Completed tasks are AUTOMATICALLY DELETED from tasks.txt
- 🗑️ Clear logging: "🗑️ Removed completed task from file: [task content]"
- 📝 Tasks file stays clean and up-to-date
- 🎉 When all tasks done: "🎉 All tasks completed! Tasks file now empty."

✅ SMART AUTO-ADVANCE (2-MINUTE RULE):
- ⏰ Checks terminal every 2 minutes during task execution
- 📊 If NO content changes in 2 minutes → auto-advances to next task
- 🚀 No more stuck tasks - system intelligently moves forward
- 📋 Clear logging: "⏰ No terminal changes in 2 minutes - auto-advancing from task X"

✅ COMPREHENSIVE TASK LOGGING:
- 📋 Task initiation: "✅ Task 0 sent to terminal: [task content]"
- 📝 Activity updates: "📝 Terminal content updated - Claude still working"
- ✅ Completion: Clear logging for both timeout and auto-advance
- 🗑️ File management: See exactly when tasks are removed

🚀 PERFECT AUTOMATION FLOW:
1. Send task → Clear logging shows task sent
2. Monitor terminal → Detect when Claude starts working  
3. Continuous monitoring → Reset timer as Claude works
4. Smart completion → Either 10-min timeout OR 2-min auto-advance
5. File cleanup → Remove completed task from tasks.txt
6. Next task → Seamless progression

WHAT IS NIGHT WRITER?
Night Writer is an intelligent terminal automation system that monitors your clipboard, 
detects when you copy tasks from Claude.ai, automatically executes them, and manages 
your task list by removing completed items.

QUICK START:
1. Double-click "Night Writer v1.1.exe" to launch the application
2. Click "🔄 REFRESH WINDOWS" to scan for available terminal windows
3. Select a terminal window from the list (Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc.)
4. Click "🚀 START AUTOMATION" to begin monitoring

HOW IT WORKS:
- The app monitors your clipboard for task lists copied from Claude.ai
- When tasks are detected, it automatically types them into your selected terminal
- **NEW**: Clear logging shows exactly when each task is sent AND removed from file
- Smart detection: if terminal content changes and it's not a rate limit → Claude is working!
- **NEW**: 2-minute rule: if no terminal changes, auto-advances to prevent getting stuck
- **NEW**: Completed tasks automatically deleted from tasks.txt file
- Continuous monitoring: inactivity timer resets as Claude continues working
